# Mongo API Project

This week's assignment was to build a RESTful API using MongoDB

## The problem

I used Mongo Compass and Atlas for the database. I used and async and await approach rather than a .then for asynchronous parts. The dataset was my own, an only slightly modified version of last week's. I didn't have a lot of time this week, so I went very basic. If I had more time I would have added more queries and more endpoints, as well as create another collection in the database.
